## Happy to meet you !

Looking for information about me ? Here is what you need to know :

- My background : I am a statistician and machine learning professional by education, with a background in mathematics and research. 


- My passion : solving data science problems from theory to practice - and vice versa ! - using languages and technologies such as OpenCV, Python, TensorFlow, Keras, R, Shiny, SQL, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes etc., in fields such as the manufacturing industry, energy, the medical sector, agronomy, etc.  I am used to develop new statistical & machine learning methods, or to apply state of the art techniques from statistics, machine and deep learning (e.g. Bayesian & Frequentist approaches, Kernel methods, Ensemble methods, Deep-NN, Conv-NN, etc.).


- What I have achieved so far :
  - I developed the Maintenance Factory SaaS suite, for one of my companies named [CYM](https://cym-iot.com/en/), which performs real-time analyses using machine, sensor or telemetric data and aims at reducing costs and increasing production within the manufacturing intelligence and predictive maintenance framework.
  - I developed the [Prio Retino](https://gaiha.org/fr/3dr/) SaaS approach, based on deep convolutional neural networks, which allows automated referable diabetic retinopathy, maculopathy, and glaucoma detection. This approach has been benchmarked with another approach cleared by the FDA in the USA and allows ; 1) fast, 2) massive and 3) regular screening and follow-up of patients.  The [Prio Retino](https://gaiha.org/fr/3dr/) SaaS is currently used by a [World Health Organization (WHO) Center in Dakar](https://abassndao.business.site/)
  - I developed the CRAN package [KRMM](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/KRMM/index.html) for solving "Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space" (RKHS) regression, used by teams of INRA and CIRAD for genomic prediction and analyses, which competes with current implementations of SVM, random forests and neural networks within the omic framework.

  - I supervised an amazing team of data scientists at [OKP4](https://okp4.network/?et_blog) where we develop many AI based services, for a decentralized protocol, which will allow data sharing and new knowledge creation

- What I am doing currently : I am the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of a company named GAIHA which offers AI SaaS solutions, which are scientifically and clinically validated cutting edge technologies, for:

    - referable diabetic retinopathy, its level of severity, and maculopathy detection based on fundus images
    
    - referable glaucoma detection based on fundus images

    - early breast cancer detection based on blood sample and anthropometric measurements
